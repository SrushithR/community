title: AWS Serverless Workshop
description: "This is a hands-on workshop, where you will build and deploy a simple web application that enables users to vote for their favorite options for a set of questions. It also provides the capability to create their own custom polls. The voting application is built using AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync and Amazon DynamoDB. The interface on the backend is powered by GraphQL, which will submit the request and update the noSQL database using queries and mutations. "
